A log reader, that reads right behind the log writer and does 'things'
======================================================================

## Instructing log reader to consume log for one specific day 

What follows is a combined log (from stdout) so individual process logs are mixed.

Starting log reader monitor (monitoring a specific day)
```
âžœ ./zlogread . 2024-09-30
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.479004] [debug] Will instantiate sub-processes using executable: "./zlogread"
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.479316] [info] Monitoring directory: "./2024/9/30"
```
The log reader monitor detects header- and payload log file pairs, and spawns individual child processes for processing each pair
```
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.481429] [info] Processor #1 (pid=12238) handles file0.header and file0.payload

[2024-10-01 11:41:44.493504] [info] Processor #8 (pid=12248) handles file7.header and file7.payload
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.495270] [info] Processor #9 (pid=12249) handles file8.header and file8.payload
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.497037] [info] Processor #10 (pid=12250) handles file9.header and file9.payload
```
Each individual child process picks up log file pairs and starts reading from the header file
```

[2024-10-01 11:41:44.518688] [info] Processor #7 starting at position 0 in ./2024/9/30/file6.header
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.520379] [info] Processor #8 starting at position 0 in ./2024/9/30/file7.header
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.522114] [info] Processor #9 starting at position 0 in ./2024/9/30/file8.header
[2024-10-01 11:41:44.526291] [info] Processor #10 starting at position 0 in ./2024/9/30/file9.header
```
One of the header files have been manually doctored to only have half a header (last in file), which makes it impossible for the log reader to process the entry.
All other log reader processes finishes, while the last one struggles for a while.

The log monitor picks up the report from the struggling child process
```

```
...and collects the other child processes as well.

Having tackled 2024-09-30 (somewhat), the log monitor calls it a day.
